# Example Template File

# This file shows the format for approved card templates.
# Templates are automatically created when patterns receive enough positive feedback.
#
# Promotion thresholds:
# - 3+ positive feedbacks: Promoted to type="template" in Qdrant
# - 10+ positive feedbacks: Promoted to YAML file (like this one)
#
# Templates can also be manually created for common card patterns.
