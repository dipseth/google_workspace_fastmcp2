    """Test scope consolidation for optimized authentication and authorization.

🔧 MCP Tools Used:
- Scope management tools: Consolidate and optimize OAuth scopes
- Authentication optimization: Reduce scope redundancy and conflicts
- Permission validation: Validate consolidated scope permissions
- Scope analytics: Analyze scope usage and optimization opportunities

🧪 What's Being Tested:
- OAuth scope consolidation and optimization
- Reduced authentication overhead through scope management
- Permission validation with consolidated scopes
- Scope conflict detection and resolution
- Performance improvements from scope optimization
- Backwards compatibility with existing scope configurations
- Security validation of consolidated authentication patterns

🔍 Potential Duplications:
- Authentication patterns overlap with OAuth session context and auth pattern tests
- Scope management might overlap with service authentication tests
- Optimization patterns similar to other performance optimization tests
- Permission validation might overlap with authorization tests in other components
