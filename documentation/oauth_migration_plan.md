# OAuth Migration Plan: FastMCP 2.12.0 GoogleProvider Integration
## Comprehensive Implementation Roadmap

---

## Executive Summary

This migration plan provides a detailed, phased approach to implementing the unified OAuth architecture using FastMCP 2.12.0's GoogleProvider. The plan ensures zero downtime, maintains backward compatibility, and provides clear rollback procedures at each phase.

**Migration Duration**: 10-12 weeks  
**Risk Level**: Medium (with mitigation strategies)  
**Impact**: All OAuth-dependent tools and services  

---

## Phase 1: Environment Setup & Core Components (Weeks 1-2)

### 1.1 Pre-Migration Preparation

#### Environment Configuration
```yaml
Tasks:
  - Backup current configuration and credentials
  - Set up development/staging environment
  - Configure FastMCP 2.12.0 GoogleProvider settings
  - Validate OAuth client credentials
  - Set up monitoring infrastructure

Required Environment Variables:
  FASTMCP_SERVER_AUTH: "GOOGLE"
  FASTMCP_SERVER_AUTH_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID: "<client_id>"
  FASTMCP_SERVER_AUTH_GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET: "<client_secret>"
  FASTMCP_SERVER_AUTH_GOOGLE_BASE_URL: "http://localhost"
  ENABLE_UNIFIED_AUTH: "false"  # Feature flag for gradual rollout
```

#### Core Component Development

**1. UnifiedSession Class Implementation**
```
Location: auth/unified_session.py
Dependencies: FastMCP 2.12.0 GoogleProvider
Testing: Unit tests required before proceeding
```

**2. Session Bridge Development**
```
Location: auth/session_bridge.py
Purpose: Bridge FastMCP context with tool expectations
Critical Methods:
  - map_fastmcp_to_tool_context()
  - synthesize_credentials()
  - cache_services()
```

**3. Credential Storage Bridge**
```
Location: auth/credential_bridge.py
Purpose: Abstract storage layer for gradual migration
Features:
  - Dual-mode storage support
  - Format translation
  - Migration tracking
```

### 1.2 Validation Checkpoints

- [ ] GoogleProvider successfully authenticates test user
- [ ] UnifiedSession correctly extracts email from token claims
- [ ] Session Bridge creates valid Google service objects
- [ ] Credential Bridge reads/writes both formats
- [ ] Feature flag toggles between old/new flow

### 1.3 Rollback Trigger Points

- GoogleProvider authentication failures > 5%
- Session creation errors > 1%
- Service object creation failures
- Credential storage corruption

---

## Phase 2: Migration Infrastructure & Compatibility (Weeks 3-5)

### 2.1 Middleware Implementation

#### GoogleServiceInjectionMiddleware
```python
Implementation Tasks:
  1. Create middleware skeleton
  2. Implement token extraction from GoogleProvider
  3. Add service caching mechanism
  4. Implement context injection logic
  5. Add backward compatibility parameter injection
  
Critical Features:
  - Automatic user_google_email injection for legacy tools
  - Service object pooling
  - Token refresh handling
  - Error recovery mechanisms
```

#### Compatibility Layer Architecture
```mermaid
graph TD
    subgraph Request Flow
        A[Incoming Request] --> B[Middleware]
        B --> C{Tool Type?}
        C -->|Legacy| D[Add user_email param]
        C -->|Enhanced| E[Inject context]
        D --> F[Execute Tool]
        E --> F
    end
```

### 2.2 Data Migration Strategy

#### Credential Migration Plan
```yaml
Stage 1 - Discovery:
  - Inventory all existing credentials
  - Identify active vs. expired tokens
  - Map credential formats
  - Calculate migration scope

Stage 2 - Shadow Migration:
  - Copy credentials to new format
  - Maintain dual storage
  - Verify format conversion
  - Track migration metrics

Stage 3 - Validation:
  - Test credential access patterns
  - Verify service creation
  - Validate scope preservation
  - Confirm refresh token functionality
```

### 2.3 Tool Compatibility Matrix

| Tool Category | Current State | Migration Approach | Priority |
|--------------|--------------|-------------------|----------|
| Drive Tools | Requires email | Middleware injection | High |
| Gmail Tools | Requires email | Middleware injection | High |
| Calendar Tools | Requires email | Middleware injection | High |
| Chat Tools | Mixed approach | Selective update | Medium |
| Auth Tools | Direct OAuth | Refactor to GoogleProvider | Critical |

### 2.4 Validation Checkpoints

- [ ] Middleware successfully intercepts all tool calls
- [ ] Legacy tools receive user_email parameter
- [ ] Enhanced tools receive context object
- [ ] Credential migration preserves all data
- [ ] Service creation performance < 100ms overhead

---

## Phase 3: Tool Integration & Progressive Rollout (Weeks 6-8)

### 3.1 Tool Migration Priority Matrix

#### Critical Path Tools (Week 6)
```
1. Authentication Tools
   - start_google_auth → Use GoogleProvider directly
   - check_drive_auth → Query GoogleProvider state
   
2. High-Usage Tools
   - search_drive_files
   - search_gmail_messages
   - create_event (Calendar)
```

#### Secondary Tools (Week 7)
```
3. Document Management
   - create_doc
   - update_sheet_values
   - create_form
   
4. Communication Tools
   - send_gmail_message
   - list_spaces (Chat)
```

#### Enhancement Tools (Week 8)
```
5. Enhanced Tools (already context-aware)
   - Validate compatibility
   - Remove redundant code
   - Optimize performance
```

### 3.2 Progressive Rollout Strategy

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[5% Traffic] -->|Success| B[25% Traffic]
    B -->|Success| C[50% Traffic]
    C -->|Success| D[100% Traffic]
    
    A -->|Issues| E[Rollback]
    B -->|Issues| E
    C -->|Issues| E
```

**Rollout Schedule:**
- Day 1-2: 5% of traffic (monitoring heavy)
- Day 3-4: 25% of traffic (performance validation)
- Day 5-6: 50% of traffic (load testing)
- Day 7: 100% deployment (with rollback ready)

### 3.3 Feature Flag Configuration

```python
Feature Flags:
  UNIFIED_AUTH_ENABLED: Control new auth flow
  LEGACY_COMPAT_MODE: Force backward compatibility
  CREDENTIAL_MIGRATION: Enable credential migration
  SERVICE_CACHING: Enable service object caching
  ENHANCED_LOGGING: Verbose migration logging
  
Per-Tool Flags:
  TOOL_{name}_ENHANCED: Enable enhanced mode per tool
```
