# Enhanced Sampling Middleware for FastMCP2 Google Workspace Platform

## Overview

The Enhanced Sampling Middleware extends the base sampling capabilities by making the client LLM **resource-aware** and **context-intelligent**. Instead of generic sampling, this middleware dynamically enriches sampling requests with relevant data from the FastMCP2 platform's extensive resource ecosystem, Qdrant knowledge base, and template system.

## ðŸŽ¯ Core Philosophy

**"Make the LLM smart about what's available"** - The middleware transforms sampling from simple text generation to **contextually-aware assistance** that understands:

- What resources are available (user data, Gmail, Drive, etc.)
- What tools can be used for follow-up actions
- Historical patterns from previous tool responses (via Qdrant)
- Current user context and preferences

## ðŸš€ Key Enhancements Over Base Sampling

### 1. **Resource-Aware Prompting**
Instead of basic prompts, inject available resource information to guide the LLM:

```python
# Before (Generic)
prompt = "Analyze this text: {text}"

# After (Resource-Aware)
prompt = """
Available Resources: {resource_summary}
User Context: {user_context}
Recent Activity: {recent_workspace_activity}

Now analyze this text with awareness of the user's context: {text}

Consider suggesting relevant actions using available tools like:
- Gmail operations (labels: {gmail_labels})
- Drive file management
- Workspace search and organization
"""
```

### 2. **Qdrant-Enhanced Context**
Dynamically pull relevant historical data from Qdrant to inform sampling:

```python
# Search Qdrant for related previous responses
related_responses = await qdrant_search(
    query=f"user:{user_email} similar_task", 
    limit=3
)

# Enrich sampling with historical context
enhanced_prompt = f"""
Historical Context (from previous similar tasks):
{format_qdrant_responses(related_responses)}

Current Task: {original_prompt}
"""
```

### 3. **Template-Powered Dynamic Prompts**
Use the Template Parameter Middleware to create context-aware prompts:

```python
# Template-enhanced sampling prompt
template_prompt = """
Hello {{user://current/email.name}}!

Based on your profile and recent activity:
- Email: {{user://current/email.email}}
- Recent files: {{workspace://content/recent.total_files}}
- Gmail labels: {{service://gmail/labels | length}}

{% if workspace://content/recent.total_files > 10 %}
I notice you have quite a few recent files. 
{% endif %}

Now, regarding your request: {user_request}

I can help you with actions like:
{% for tool in tools://enhanced/list.enhanced_tools[:5] %}
- {{tool.name}}: {{tool.description}}
{% endfor %}
"""
```

## ðŸ“š Available Resource Categories for Sampling Enhancement

SAMPLING_RESOURCES = {
    "user_context": [
        "user://current/email",           # Current user email and name
        "user://current/profile",         # Full user profile with auth status
        "auth://session/current"          # Current session information
    ],
    
    "workspace_context": [
        "workspace://content/recent",     # Recent workspace activity
        "workspace://content/search/{query}"  # Dynamic search results
    ],

        "qdrant://search/{query}",       # Semantic search across history
        "qdrant://collections/list"      # Available knowledge collections
    ]
}
```

## ðŸ”§ Enhanced Sampling Templates

### 1. **Context-Aware Analysis Template**
```python
CONTEXT_AWARE_ANALYSIS = {
    "system_prompt": """

Available Resources:
- User Profile: {{user://current/profile}}
- Recent Workspace Activity: {{workspace://content/recent}}  
- Gmail Organization: {{service://gmail/labels}}
- Available Tools: {{tools://enhanced/list}}

When analyzing requests, consider:
1. The user's current context and recent activity
2. What tools/resources could help achieve their goals
3. Relevant patterns from their workspace usage
4. Actionable next steps using available capabilities

Always be specific about available tools and resources that could help.

## ðŸ“Š Example Enhanced Sampling Flow

```python
@mcp.tool
async def smart_email_assistant(
    user_request: str, 
    ctx: ContextEnrichedSamplingContext
) -> str:
    """Smart email assistant with full context awareness."""
    
    # Enhanced sampling with all context
    response = await ctx.enhanced_sample(
        messages=f"""
        User Request: {user_request}
        
        Please provide a helpful response considering:
        1. The user's Gmail setup and labels
        2. Their recent workspace activity  
        3. Available tools for follow-up actions
        4. Any relevant historical patterns
        
        Be specific about tools and resources that could help.
        """,
        template=SamplingTemplate.CONTEXT_AWARE_ANALYSIS,
        enhancement_level="historical",
        relevant_resources=[
            "service://gmail/labels",
            "workspace://content/recent", 
            "tools://enhanced/list"
        ],
        include_historical=True
    )
    
    return response.text
```

**Sample Enhanced Response:**
```
Based on your Gmail setup (I see you have 15 labels including "Work Projects" and "Client Communications") and your recent activity (42 files modified this week, mostly presentations), here's how I can help:

For your request about organizing project emails, I can:

1. **Use the 'gmail_create_filter' tool** to automatically label emails from specific projects
2. **Use the 'workspace_search_content' tool** to find related documents in your Drive
3. **Use the 'gmail_bulk_organize' tool** to batch-process existing emails

I noticed from your previous interactions that you successfully used a similar workflow 2 weeks ago for the "Marketing Campaign" project. Would you like me to apply a similar pattern here?

Available next steps:
- Create Gmail filters: `gmail_create_filter(criteria=..., label="Work Projects")`  
- Search related files: `workspace_search_content(query="project name")`
- Organize existing emails: `gmail_bulk_organize(label_strategy="by_project")`
```
